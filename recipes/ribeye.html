    <h1>The Perfect Pan Seared Ribeye!</h1>
    <img style="width: 400px;height: 400px; object-fit: cover;" src="../images/ribeye.jpg" alt="Pan Seared Ribeye">
    <p style="width: 400px;">This is my favorite way to prepare a Ribeye. Nothing brings out the juicy flavors of a ribeye like a nice sear in a cast iron.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (For Two)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless ribeye steaks, 1-inch thick (about 10-16 ounces each)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary , and/or thyme</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steaks from the refrigerator 60 minutes prior to cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast iron pan over medium-high heat until hot. Meanwhile, pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Once the oil is very hot, add the steaks to the skillet and sear them on each side for 3 to 4 minutes, until browned.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic and herbs to the pan. Carefully spoon the butter sauce over the steak and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the steak is 140 to 150 degres F for medium doneness (or 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness.)</li>
        <li>Transfer the steaks to a cutting board, cover them loosely with foil and allow them to rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>

    </ol>
